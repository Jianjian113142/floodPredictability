# Highly Synchronized Widespread Floods Mean Higher Predictability in Monsoon Regions

This repository provides the code for flood predictability and Highly Synchronized Widespread Floods analysis.

These codes include R code and Julia code. The Julia code is mainly used for recurrence quantification analysis (including DET etc. and significance test), and R is used for result comparison and graphics analysis. See the code and comments for details.
